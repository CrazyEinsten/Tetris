# Tetris
  This is my first git.<br/>
  In this summer, i finished my first project as a Tetris. <br/>
  Used the C and the win32 API to draw my GUI.<br/>
  Although it just a little game, i wanna make something different.<br/>
  The program include the Threading, GUI, winsocket and so on.<br/>
  But there are also many functions i didnt realize as there are only 4 days for me to finish this program.<br/>
  The functions which i wanna realize are inlcude two-players battle and the AI vs Player.<br/>
  The AI I plan to write with the greedy algorithm （emmmm I think there is no need to let the AI have very great intelligence hiahia）<br/>
  
  This is my first git, I believe I can do better in the tomorrow
