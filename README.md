# Tetris
  This is my first git.
  In this summer, i finished my first project as a Tetris. 
  Used the C and the win32 API to draw my GUI.
  Although it just a little game, i wanna make something different.
  The program include the Threading, GUI, winsocket and so on.
  But there are also many functions i didnt realize as there are only 4 days for me to finish this program.
  The functions which i wanna realize are inlcude two-players battle and the AI vs Player.
  The AI I plan to write with the greedy algorithm （emmmm I think there is no need to let the AI have very great intelligence hiahia）
  
  This is my first git, I believe I can do better in the tomorrow
